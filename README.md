# (Name TBD) Build System

This is going to be a build system written in python and using python for
configuration, allowing for very simple and flexible project setup.
Cross-compiling will be a first-class feature.

Currently, the repository is named Bulldozer, but I am not set on that name. The
name is extremely likely to change.
